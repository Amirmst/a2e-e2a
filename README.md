# a2e-e2a
C program to convert ASCII files to EBCDIC and EBCDIC files to ASCII

    A C-language program which converts ASCII to EBCDIC and also
    converts EBCDIC to ASCII. This program takes one extra and
    only one command line argument (e2a OR a2e) which specifies which
    conversion should be performed. This program reads input from
    stdin and writes the converted output to stdout.
    
    When the conversion will not be lossless, the return
    status is a negative number.
